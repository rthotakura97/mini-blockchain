# mini-blockchain
Server-run blockchain built from scratch. The blockchain exchanges a fake currency and implements all the defining features of a
standard blockchain including:
* SHA-256 hashing for security
* Decentralization
* Block mining
* Consensus protocol
* Immutability 
* Party identity abstraction
